<!-- The !DOCTYPE declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. For HTML5 (the most recent version of HTML supported by browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.), you can write it like this.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
    The html tag indicates the root HTML element. An HTML element is the collection of starting tag (e.g., <html>), all enclosed content, and ending tag (e.g., </html>). Most elements have an opening and closing tag, e.g. <html> and </html>. Most browsers can read tag names as case-insensitive, but the general style is to use lowercase. Tags can also have attributes, which are data fields (sometimes these are required) that help tell the browser how the data should be rendered.

            The Document Object Model
        
            A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same data in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the web page as a tree data structure, and allows the HTML to be manipulated via CSS and Javascript.
            Here's a couple of resources for learning more about the DOM:
                https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSv2KIF7uE4 
            You should get used to using DevTools, especially the page inspector and web console. The Javascript debugger is also a nice tool, though we won't specifically cover it in CSE 494.
                Chrome: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools
                Firefox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools
            DevTools will make debugging your homework and project code much easier and faster by allowing you to see and trace what happens in the DOM.

        <!--
            We'll get into Javascript soon, but here are some examples of embedding it directly into a webpage using a <script> element.
            If you place the <script> tag in the <head> element, it will run as soon as the page is loaded. If you are referencing elemnts in your page (that haven't yet been parsed/rendered, this is a bad idea. However, you can also have Jacascript run in response to events: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp                
                
            Below, it's an "onclick" event. Other events include onmouseover, onload, and onkeydown. Try changing the onclick to one of those.
        -->
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <button onclick="hello();">Hello!</button>
        <script>
            function hello() {
                alert('Well, hello there!!');
            }
        </script>
        <!--
            Javascript can also be factored out of the HTML entirely. Here's an example of that approach.
        -->
        <button id="goodbyeButton">Goodbye!</button>
        <script>
            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
                document.querySelector('#goodbyeButton').onclick = goodbye;
            });
            function goodbye() {
                alert('Goodbye, old friend...');
            }
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
